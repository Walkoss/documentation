To bounce an application, you can either:

- Run `plural bounce <app-name>` in the CLI or Cloud Shell
- Go to the Plural Console, select your application in the top right, then click the `Bounce` button on the Console home page (Builds).

## When to bounce an application

Bouncing an application redeploys the application in your cloud provider. You may need to redeploy an installed application for reasons including:

- Resolving transient errors in deployment
- Resolving transient errors with your cloud provider
- Refreshing the Plural Console to get an updated view of your repository
- Applying changes to an application that require a redeploy
